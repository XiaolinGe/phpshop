                        individually sold web templates.</p>

                    <p>The way we approach each template development phase is as follows:<br>
                    <ol>
                        <li>xxxxx</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>yyyyy
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li>zzzzz
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li> aaa
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>The average template takes about 7-15 hours to produce. Our goal as a design studio is to provide
                        our customers with not only a vast quantity of templates, but to have each of them backed up
                        with exceptional quality that will make your visitors coming back time and time again, just to
                        see your visually stunning website!</p>
